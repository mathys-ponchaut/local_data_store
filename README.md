lds.edit_custom_path(r"MY_VARIABLE_PATH", r"ABSOLUTE\PATH\TO\A\FILE") # Set a variable saved in Local\local_data_store\paths.json
path = r"ABSOLUTE\PATH\TO\ANOTHER\FILE" # Function also works with a given string

# Create a new .json file or rewrite it and save "Hello" in it
lds.write("MY_VARIABLE_PATH", "Hello")
lds.write(path, "Bye!")

# Read the file
print("--- With variable:")
print(lds.read("MY_VARIABLE_PATH"))
print("--- With 'path':")
print(lds.read(path))
print(lds.read("Bye!"))

# Append a data in the file
lds.append("MY_VARIABLE_PATH", "Hey")
